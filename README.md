# Bottle Filling Industry Project

## Introduction
This project aims to automate the bottel filling process in the industry by using sensors and actuators to control various stages of the process. The main goal is to increase efficiency, reduce manual intervention and improve the overall quality of the bottel filling process.

## Sensors and Actuators
The project employs various sensors and actuators to monitor and control different stages of the bottel filling process. The sensors are used to detect the presence of bottels, measure their volume and detect any anomalies. The actuators are used to control the flow of liquids, fill the bottels, cap them and label them.

## Technology Used
The project uses microcontrollers like Arduino to interface with the sensors and actuators and process the data. The microcontroller communicates with the central control system through communication protocols like Modbus and I2C. A graphical user interface is also developed using a technology like Flutter to allow for remote monitoring and control of the bottel filling process.

## How it Works
The bottel filling process starts with the placement of the bottel by the operator. The sensors then detect the presence of the bottel and measure its volume. If the volume is within the acceptable range, the actuators take over and control the flow of liquids into the bottel. The bottel is then capped and labeled by the actuators. Any anomalies detected during the process are reported to the central control system for further action.

## Benefits
The bottel filling industry project offers several benefits including:
- Increased efficiency and reduced manual intervention
- Improved quality of the bottel filling process
- Real-time monitoring and control of the process
- Enhanced safety through the use of sensors and actuators
- Reduction in waste through better control of the bottel filling process

## Conclusion
The bottel filling industry project is a step towards the automation of the bottel filling process and offers several benefits to the industry. With the use of sensors and actuators, the project offers a more efficient, safe and high-quality bottel filling process.
